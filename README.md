PROJECT TOPIC (offline, i.e. DM me) - before next Tuesday, February 16th
This checkpoint means that you have:

a dataset - needs to have at least 500+ rows. Please send a the link to the dataset.
the link for data set ## Dataset
 Medical Insurance Costs dataset :https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/386vmj2tbk/4

a target - this can be either continuous (regression problem) or categorical (classification problem). I would recommend choosing a classification problem because it really helps you understand some of the trade-offs you need to do in ML, i.e. precision vs recall. Regression tends to be easier to optimize for.
 You can also send multiple ideas and I'm happy to rank them.

 ML FIRST RESULTS - before Saturday, February 21st
This checkpoint means that you ran at least one ML model and got the test results (R2 score OR precision/recall). Easy. Don't overthink it.

 PRESENTATION FIRST DRAFT  + SOME EDA - before Tuesday, February 24th
As per usual, expecting a quick outline of your presentation without any fancy templates. This time, I would like to also see some charts that would help out with your narrative!

 MORE ML RESULTS - before Saturday, February 28th
Here I expect you to present a table with the different combinations of models + features + parameters you tried and the metrics you got for each.

 DEPLOYMENT - before Thursday, March 5th
Show me your API or Streamlit app! Will mention more in a few moments...

Finally, I will soon release 2 extra lessons for those of you particularly interested in ML and building things with Python to review. They are about Streamlit (a library you can use to build apps!) and PyCaret (a library you can use to simplify/automate ML experimentation).

I would recommend Streamlit to most of you because it's quite a handy library and, if you manage to learn it, it can make the ML much more visual and it would be like you building a product for someone. Not necessary to be a good data analyst, but a nice-to-have.

 VERY IMPORTANT: On February 28th, you WILL NOT work on the project (that's the day of the Ironkaggle) - so please keep in mind when planning!
